#Food By Mood

##A short description of our application:

  Food By Mood is an application where anyone can find foods and recipes based
  on the mood they are in.  There are 8 main moods that users can choose from
  and once a mood is chosen, the user can see all foods associated with that
  mood, ranked by votes.  Every user has the ability to add, update, delete
  and vote on foods as they wish.  When users update or create foods, they can
  add descriptions, recipes etc.

##A short description of the technologies used:

  This front-end application was built using Angular and is
  dependant on Angular and HTTP.

##The approach we took:

  Sandy, Matt and I all met up the weekend before to discuss project ideas and
  foodbymood was the unanimous winner.  After doing the ERDs and wireframes and
  discussing the schemas we would use and writing down tentative user stories,
  on Monday morning when we started, we were ready to go.  This repository
  contains all the front-end code and was made in unison with our back end api.
  Using single model projects as references, we were able to get off to a good
  start and figured out how to incorporate a second model in a one-to-many
  relationship.  Some of the challenges we encountered and overcame were
  using model relationships correctly, linking values to a selected value chosen
  by the user, and displaying and storing users votes correctly.
